I'm PhD Candidate at <a href="https://lids.mit.edu/people/faculty-pi">MIT LIDS</a>, advised by <a href="https://azizan.mit.edu/index.html">Prof. Navid Azizan</a>.
My research is driven by understanding the failure modes of AI models used in real-world systems and addressing them.
Specifically,my current research interest lies in <strong>quantifying reliability in LLMs and their reasoning process </strong>.

I was an AI research engineer at <a href="https://naver-career.gitbook.io/en/teams/clova-cic/ai-lab">NAVER AI Lab & CLOVA</a> (2019-2022).
At NAVER, I researched on <strong> recommender systems </strong> using LLMs and large-scale representation learning for <strong> industrial forecasting </strong>.

I received my M.S. and B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (minor) from <a href="https://lics.kaist.ac.kr">KAIST</a> in 2019 and 2017, respectively, 
under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5hGAWMAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Han-Lim Choi</a>.
During my masterâ€™s degree, I researched 1) <strong> hierarchical RL </strong> and 2) <strong> deep latent variable models </strong>.
